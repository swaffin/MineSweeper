INSTRUCTIONS
============
>>> The goal of MineSweeper is to determine the locations of 10 bombs and work around the mines to win the game. 

>>> Every time you enter the game, you'll type in the coordinates of each box, example:
 A7.

>>> If there is a mine in that box, you have lost the game. If there isn't a mine on the number of bombs directly surrounding that square, including diagonally, will appear in that square.

>>> If that number is a 0, the squares around it will be 'opened' automatically, as there cannot be any bombs there, to save you time.

>>> If you think you know the position of a bomb, type 'M' followed by the coordinates of that box, example: 
 MB4.

>>> You win by 'opening' all of the box's except those with bombs in.

Good luck!
